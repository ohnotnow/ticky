This application is a proof-of-concept Laravel/Livewire app that lets IT support staff submit support tickets to a large language model for automated routing. Its primary users are IT support teams who need to determine the best team or person to handle a given ticket. It solves the problem of manual triage by using an org/staff chart and a triage prompt to generate routing recommendations and store conversation history.
